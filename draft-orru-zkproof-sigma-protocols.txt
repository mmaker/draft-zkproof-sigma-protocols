               draft-orru-zkproof-sigma-protocols-latest

Abstract

   This document describes interactive sigma protocols, a class of
   secure, general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge consisting
   of three moves: commitment, challenge, and response.  Concretely, the
   protocol allows one to prove knowledge of a secret witness without
   revealing any information about it.

1.  Introduction

   Any sigma protocol must define three objects: a _commitment_
   (computed by the prover), a _challenge_ (computed by the verifier),
   and a _response_ (computed by the prover).

1.1.  Core interface

   The public functions are obtained relying on an internal structure
   containing the definition of a sigma protocol.

  class SigmaProtocol:
     def new(instance) -> SigmaProtocol
     def prover_commit(self, witness, rng) -> (commitment, prover_state)
     def prover_response(self, prover_state, challenge) -> response
     def verifier(self, commitment, challenge, response) -> bool
     def serialize_commitment(self, commitment) -> bytes
     def serialize_response(self, response) -> bytes
     def deserialize_commitment(self, data: bytes) -> commitment
     def deserialize_response(self, data: bytes) -> response
     # optional
     def simulate_response(self, rng) -> response
     # optional
     def simulate_commitment(self, response, challenge) -> commitment

   Where:

   *  new(instance) -> SigmaProtocol, denoting the initialization
      function.  This function takes as input an instance generated via
      the LinearRelation, the public information shared between prover
      and verifier.

   *  prover_commit(self, witness: Witness, rng) -> (commitment,
      prover_state), denoting the *commitment phase*, that is, the
      computation of the first message sent by the prover in a Sigma
      protocol.  This method outputs a new commitment together with its
      associated prover state, depending on the witness known to the
      prover, the statement to be proven, and a random number generator
      rng.  This step generally requires access to a high-quality
      entropy source to perform the commitment.  Leakage of even just of
      a few bits of the commitment could allow for the complete recovery
      of the witness.  The commitment is meant to be shared, while
      prover_state must be kept secret.

   *  prover_response(self, prover_state, challenge) -> response,
      denoting the *response phase*, that is, the computation of the
      second message sent by the prover, depending on the witness, the
      statement, the challenge received from the verifier, and the
      internal state prover_state.  The returned value response is meant
      to be shared.

   *  verifier(self, commitment, challenge, response) -> bool, denoting
      the *verifier algorithm*. This method checks that the protocol
      transcript is valid for the given statement.  The verifier
      algorithm outputs true if verification succeeds, or false if
      verification fails.

   *  serialize_commitment(self, commitment) -> bytes, serializes the
      commitment into a canonical byte representation.

   *  serialize_response(self, response) -> bytes, serializes the
      response into a canonical byte representation.

   *  deserialize_commitment(self, data: bytes) -> commitment,
      deserializes a byte array into a commitment.  This function can
      raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails.

   *  deserialize_response(self, data: bytes) -> response, deserializes
      a byte array into a response.  This function can raise a
      DeserializeError if deserialization fails.

   The final two algorithms describe the *zero-knowledge simulator*. In
   particular, they may be used for proof composition (e.g. OR-
   composition).  The function simulate_commitment is also used when
   verifying short proofs.  We have:

   *  simulate_response(self, rng) -> response, denoting the first stage
      of the simulator.  It is an algorithm drawing a random response
      given a specified cryptographically secure RNG that follows the
      same output distribution of the algorithm prover_response.

   *  simulate_commitment(self, response, challenge) -> commitment,
      returning a simulated commitment -- the second phase of the zero-
      knowledge simulator.

   Together, these zero-knowledge simulators provide a transcript that
   should be computationally indistinguishable from the transcript
   generated by running the original sigma protocol.

   The abstraction SigmaProtocol allows implementing different types of
   statements and combiners of those, such as OR statements, validity of
   t-out-of-n statements, and more.

2.  Sigma protocols over prime-order groups

   The following sub-section presents concrete instantiations of sigma
   protocols over prime-order elliptic curve groups.  It relies on a
   prime-order elliptic-curve group as described in Section 2.1.

   Valid choices of elliptic curves can be found in Section 2.3.

   Traditionally, sigma protocols are defined in Camenisch-Stadler
   notation as (for example):

   1. DLEQ(G, H, X, Y) = PoK{
   2.   (x):        // Secret variables
   3.   X = x * G, Y = x * H        // Predicates to satisfy
   4. }

   In the above, line 1 declares that the proof name is "DLEQ", the
   public information (the *instance*) consists of the group elements
   (G, X, H, Y) denoted in upper-case.  Line 2 states that the private
   information (the *witness*) consists of the scalar x.  Finally, line
   3 states that the linear relation that need to be proven is x * G = X
   and x * H = Y.

2.1.  Group abstraction

   Because of their dominance, the presentation in the following focuses
   on proof goals over elliptic curves, therefore leveraging additive
   notation.  For prime-order subgroups of residue classes, all notation
   needs to be changed to multiplicative, and references to elliptic
   curves (e.g., curve) need to be replaced by their respective
   counterparts over residue classes.

   We detail the functions that can be invoked on these objects.
   Example choices can be found in Section 2.3.

2.1.1.  Group

   *  identity(), returns the neutral element in the group.

   *  generator(), returns the generator of the prime-order elliptic-
      curve subgroup used for cryptographic operations.

   *  order(): Outputs the order of the group p.

   *  random(): outputs a random element in the group.

   *  serialize(elements: [Group; N]), serializes a list of group
      elements and returns a canonical byte array buf of fixed length Ne
      * N.

   *  deserialize(buffer), attempts to map a byte array buffer of size
      Ne * N into [Group; N], and fails if the input is not the valid
      canonical byte representation of an element of the group.  This
      function can raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails.

   *  add(element: Group), implements elliptic curve addition for the
      two group elements.

   *  equal(element: Group), returns true if the two elements are the
      same and false` otherwise.

   *  scalar_mul(scalar: Scalar), implements scalar multiplication for a
      group element by an element in its respective scalar field.

   In this spec, instead of add we will use + with infix notation;
   instead of equal we will use ==, and instead of scalar_mul we will
   use *. A similar behavior can be achieved using operator overloading.

2.1.2.  Scalar

   *  identity(): outputs the (additive) identity element in the scalar
      field.

   *  add(scalar: Scalar): implements field addition for the elements in
      the field.

   *  mul(scalar: Scalar), implements field multiplication.

   *  random(): outputs a random scalar field element.

   *  serialize(scalars: list[Scalar; N]): serializes a list of scalars
      and returns their canonical representation of fixed length Ns * N.

   *  deserialize(buffer), attempts to map a byte array buffer of size
      Ns * N into [Scalar; N], and fails if the input is not the valid
      canonical byte representation of an element of the group.  This
      function can raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails.

   In this spec, instead of add we will use + with infix notation;
   instead of equal we will use ==, and instead of mul we will use *. A
   similar behavior can be achieved using operator overloading.

2.2.  Proofs of preimage of a linear map

2.2.1.  Core protocol

   This defines the object SchnorrProof.  The initialization function
   takes as input the statement, and pre-processes it.

2.2.2.  Prover procedures

   The prover of a sigma protocol is stateful and will send two
   messages, a "commitment" and a "response" message, described below.

2.2.2.1.  Prover commitment

prover_commit(self, witness, rng)

Inputs:

- witness, an array of scalars
- rng, a random number generator

Outputs:

- A (private) prover state, holding the information of the interactive prover necessary for producing the protocol response
- A (public) commitment message, an element of the linear map image, that is, a vector of group elements.

Procedure:

1. nonces = [self.instance.Domain.random(rng) for _ in range(self.instance.linear_map.num_scalars)]
2. prover_state = self.ProverState(witness, nonces)
3. commitment = self.instance.linear_map(nonces)
4. return (prover_state, commitment)

2.2.2.2.  Prover response

prover_response(self, prover_state, challenge)

Inputs:

    - prover_state, the current state of the prover
    - challenge, the verifier challenge scalar

Outputs:

    - An array of scalar elements composing the response

Procedure:

1. witness, nonces = prover_state
2. return [nonces[i] + witness[i] * challenge for i in range(self.instance.linear_map.num_scalars)]

2.2.3.  Verifier

verify(self, commitment, challenge, response)

Inputs:

- self, the current state of the SigmaProtocol
- commitment, the commitment generated by the prover
- challenge, the challenge generated by the verifier
- response, the response generated by the prover

Outputs:

- A boolean indicating whether the verification succeeded

Procedure:

1. assert len(commitment) == self.instance.linear_map.num_constraints and len(response) == self.instance.linear_map.num_scalars
2. expected = self.instance.linear_map(response)
3. got = [commitment[i] + self.instance.image[i] * challenge for i in range(self.instance.linear_map.num_constraints)]
4. return got == expected

2.2.4.  Witness representation

   A witness is simply a list of num_scalars elements.

   Witness = [Scalar; num_scalars]

2.2.5.  Linear map

   A LinearMap represents a function (a _linear map_ from the scalar
   field to the elliptic curve group) that, given as input an array of
   Scalar elements, outputs an array of Group elements.  This can be
   represented as matrix-vector (scalar) product using group multi-
   scalar multiplication.  However, since the matrix is oftentimes
   sparse, it is often more convenient to store the matrix in Yale
   sparse matrix format.

   Here is an example:

   class LinearCombination:
       scalar_indices: list[int]
       element_indices: list[int]

   The linear map can then be presented as:

   class LinearMap:
       Group: groups.Group
       linear_combinations: list[LinearCombination]
       group_elements: list[Group]
       num_scalars: int
       num_elements: int

       def map(self, scalars: list[Group.ScalarField]) -> Group

2.2.5.1.  Initialization

   The linear map LinearMap is initialized with

   linear_combinations = []
   group_elements = []
   num_scalars = 0
   num_elements = 0

2.2.5.2.  Linear map evaluation

   A witness can be mapped to a group element via:

map(self, scalars: [Scalar; num_scalars])

Inputs:

- self, the current state of the constraint system
- witness,

1. image = []
2. for linear_combination in self.linear_combinations:
3.     coefficients = [scalars[i] for i in linear_combination.scalar_indices]
4.     elements = [self.group_elements[i] for i in linear_combination.element_indices]
5.     image.append(self.Group.msm(coefficients, elements))
6. return image

2.2.6.  Statements for linear relations

   The object LinearRelation has two attributes: a linear map
   linear_map, which will be defined in Section 2.2.5, and image, the
   linear map image of which the prover wants to show the pre-image of.

   class LinearRelation: Domain = group.ScalarField Image = group.Group

       linear_map = LinearMap
       image = list[group.Group]

   def allocate_scalars(self, n: int) -> list[int]
   def allocate_elements(self, n: int) -> list[int]
   def append_equation(self, lhs: int, rhs: list[(int, int)]) -> None
   def set_elements(self, elements: list[(int, Group)]) -> None

2.2.6.1.  Element and scalar variables allocation

   Two functions allow to allocate the new scalars (the witness) and
   group elements (the instance).

allocate_scalars(self, n)

Inputs:
    - self, the current state of the LinearRelation
    - n, the number of scalars to allocate
Outputs:
    - indices, a list of integers each pointing to the new allocated scalars

Procedure:

1. indices = range(self.num_scalars, self.num_scalars + n)
2. self.num_scalars += n
3. return indices

   and below the allocation of group elements

allocate_elements(self, n)

1. linear_combination = LinearMap.LinearCombination(scalar_indices=[x[0] for x in rhs], element_indices=[x[1] for x in rhs])
2. self.linear_map.append(linear_combination)
3. self._image.append(lhs)

   Group elements, being part of the instance, can later be set using
   the function set_elements

 set_elements(self, elements)

 Inputs:
     - self, the current state of the LinearRelation
     - elements, a list of pairs of indices and group elements to be set

 Procedure:

 1. for index, element in elements:
 2.   self.linear_map.group_elements[index] = element

2.2.6.2.  Constraint enforcing

append_equation(self, lhs, rhs)

Inputs:

- self, the current state of the constraint system
- lhs, the left-hand side of the equation
- rhs, the right-hand side of the equation (a list of (ScalarIndex, GroupEltIndex) pairs)

Outputs:

- An Equation instance that enforces the desired relation

Procedure:

1. linear_combination = LinearMap.LinearCombination(scalar_indices=[x[0] for x in rhs], element_indices=[x[1] for x in rhs])
2. self.linear_map.append(linear_combination)
3. self._image.append(lhs)

2.2.7.  Example: Schnorr proofs

   The statement represented in Section 2 can be written as:

   statement = LinearRelation(group)
   [var_x] = statement.allocate_scalars(1)
   [var_G, var_X] = statement.allocate_elements(2)
   statement.append_equation(var_X, [(var_x, var_G)])

   At which point it is possible to set var_G and var_X whenever the
   group elements are at disposal.

   G = group.generator()
   statement.set_elements([(var_G, G), (var_X, X)])

   It is worth noting that in the above example, [X] ==
   statement.linear_map.map([x]).

2.2.8.  Example: DLEQ proofs

   A DLEQ proof proves a statement:

       DLEQ(G, H, X, Y) = PoK{(x): X = x * G, Y = x * H}

   Given group elements G, H and X, Y such that x * G = X and x * H = Y,
   then the statement is generated as:

   1. statement = LinearRelation()
   2. [var_x] = statement.allocate_scalars(1)
   3. statement.append_equation(X, [(var_x, G)])
   4. statement.append_equation(Y, [(var_x, H)])

2.2.9.  Example: Pedersen commitments

   A representation proof proves a statement

       REPR(G, H, C) = PoK{(x, r): C = x * G + r * H}

   Given group elements G, H such that C = x * G + r * H, then the
   statement is generated as:

   statement = LinearRelation()
   var_x, var_r = statement.allocate_scalars(2)
   statement.append_equation(C, [(var_x, G), (var_r, H)])

2.3.  Ciphersuites

2.3.1.  P-256 (secp256r1)

   This ciphersuite uses P-256 [SP800] for the Group.

2.3.1.1.  Elliptic curve group of P-256 (secp256r1) [SP800]

   *  order(): Return the integer 11579208921035624876269744694940757352
      9996955224135760342422259061068512044369.

   *  serialize([A]): Implemented using the compressed Elliptic-Curve-
      Point-to-Octet-String method according to [SEC1]; Ne = 33.

   *  deserialize(buf): Implemented by attempting to read buf into
      chunks of 33-byte arrays and convert them using the compressed
      Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-Point method according to [SEC1],
      and then performs partial public-key validation as defined in
      section 5.6.2.3.4 of [KEYAGREEMENT].  This includes checking that
      the coordinates of the resulting point are in the correct range,
      that the point is on the curve, and that the point is not the
      point at infinity.

2.3.1.2.  Scalar Field of P-256

   *  serialize(s): Relies on the Field-Element-to-Octet-String
      conversion according to [SEC1]; Ns = 32.

   *  deserialize(buf): Reads the byte array buf in chunks of 32 bytes
      using Octet-String-to-Field-Element from [SEC1].  This function
      can fail if the input does not represent a Scalar in the range [0,
      G.Order() - 1].

3.  Security Considerations

   Interactive sigma proofs are special sound and honest-verifier zero-
   knowledge.  These proofs are deniable (without transferable message
   authenticity).

   We focus on the security guarantees of the non-interactive Fiat-
   Shamir transformation, where they provide the following guarantees
   (in the random oracle model):

   *  *Knowledge soundness*: If the proof is valid, the prover must have
      knowledge of a secret witness satisfying the proof statement.
      This property ensures that valid proofs cannot be generated
      without possession of the corresponding witness.

   *  *Zero-knowledge*: The proof string produced by the prove function
      does not reveal any information beyond what can be directly
      inferred from the statement itself.  This ensures that verifiers
      gain no knowledge about the witness.

   While theoretical analysis demonstrates that both soundness and zero-
   knowledge properties are statistical in nature, practical security
   depends on the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash
   function, which is defined by the Fiat-Shamir transformation.  It's
   important to note that the soundness of a zero-knowledge proof
   provides no guarantees regarding the computational hardness of the
   relation being proven.  An assessment of the specific hardness
   properties for relations proven using these protocols falls outside
   the scope of this document.

3.1.  Privacy Considerations

   Interactive sigma proofs are insecure against malicious verifiers and
   should not be used.  The non-interactive Fiat-Shamir transformation
   leads to publicly verifiable (transferable) proofs that are
   statistically zero-knowledge.

4.  Post-Quantum Security Considerations

   The zero-knowledge proofs described in this document provide
   statistical zero-knowledge and statistical soundness properties when
   modeled in the random oracle model.

4.1.  Privacy Considerations

   These proofs offer zero-knowledge guarantees, meaning they do not
   leak any information about the prover's witness beyond what can be
   inferred from the proven statement itself.  This property holds even
   against quantum adversaries with unbounded computational power.

   Specifically, these proofs can be used to protect privacy against
   post-quantum adversaries, in applications demanding:

   *  Post-quantum anonymity

   *  Post-quantum unlinkability

   *  Post-quantum blindness

   *  Protection against "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks.

4.2.  Soundness Considerations

   While the proofs themselves offer privacy protections against quantum
   adversaries, the hardness of the relation being proven depends (at
   best) on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem over the
   elliptic curves specified in Section 2.3.  Since this problem is
   known to be efficiently solvable by quantum computers using Shor's
   algorithm, these proofs MUST NOT be relied upon for post-quantum
   soundness guarantees.

   Implementations requiring post-quantum soundness SHOULD transition to
   alternative proof systems such as:

   *  MPC-in-the-Head approaches as described in [GiacomelliMO16]

   *  Lattice-based approaches as described in [AttemaCK21]

   *  Code-based approaches as described in [Stern93]

   Implementations should consider the timeline for quantum computing
   advances when planning migration to post-quantum sound alternatives.
   Implementers MAY adopt a hybrid approach during migration to post-
   quantum security by using AND composition of proofs.  This approach
   enables gradual migration while maintaining security against
   classical adversaries.  This composition retains soundness if *both*
   problems remain hard.  AND composition of proofs is NOT described in
   this specification, but examples may be found in the proof-of-concept
   implementation and in [BonehS23].

5.  Generation of the protocol identifier

   As of now, it is responsibility of the user to pick a unique protocol
   identifier that identifies the proof system.  This will be expanded
   in future versions of this specification.

6.  Generation of the instance identifier

   As of now, it is responsibility of the user to pick a unique instance
   identifier that identifies the statement being proven.
